resource "aws_s3_bucket" "finance" {
  bucket = "my-unique-bucket-name-12345"  # Change to a globally unique name
  tags = {
    Name        = "MyS3Bucket"
  }
}

-------now upload file in this bucket - 
resource "aws_s3_object" "example_file" {
  bucket  = aws_s3_bucket.my_bucket.id
  key     = "finance.doc"  # Name of the object in S3
  content = "/root/finance/finance.doc"  # Reads the file content and uploads it
  acl     = "private"
}

--------- now i need to provide bucket access to finance group, this group was creted manually, so we need to use data - 
data "aws_iam_group" "finance-data" {
    group_name = "finance-analysts"
}

---------- create a bucket policy to attach this group to bucket
resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "finance-policy" {
    bucket = aws_s3_bucket.finance.id
    policy = <<EOF
